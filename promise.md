# graw api promise

Current Major Version: 0

Under this major version, the api promise is only warning. All breaking changes
to the graw api will be announced a minimum of one week prior to merge on the
[graw-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/graw-users).

If you use graw, please consider providing feedback on the mailing list! When
graw matures to major version 1, the api will be written in stone and sealed by
fire.
