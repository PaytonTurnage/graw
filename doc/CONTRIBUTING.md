## Git conventions

Commit messages

- State as a succinct imperative sentence the purpose that the commit fulfills. Examples like `This commit is making the flux capacitor stop wobbling` are better replaced with something like `Resolve unnecessary flux capacitor oscillation`, followed by a more telling commit message give a much better idea of what the commit does, and make it easier to read as it follows the same standards as other commits.

- 50 characters or less for the first line. In-depth explanations should be provided wherever applicable; if you're not sure whether a commit needs further description, give it further description. It can't hurt to be more thorough.

## Testing conventions

We use Travis-CI! :) Not much here to see yet.
