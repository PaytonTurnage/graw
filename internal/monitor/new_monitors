Generalization of Monitors
==========================

Many interesting endpoints on Reddit are provided as listings. New posts, user
submissions, friend submissions, etc. At this commit, postMonitor is the only
monitor that handles listings. Its behaviors for maintaining a tip are needed
for monitoring any listing. The only thing that changes between the different
listings is the endpoint and (maybe) some parameters.

postMonitor should become hollow, and shell out to a scanner. A scanner scans
its listing endpoint and maintains its tip. It returns interface{} from its scan
method in order to account for that a listing can be made of comments or posts.
This will come from a generic listing method in operator (a derivative of its
current Scrape() method).

Using the core postMonitor will shell out to, two more monitors will be made:
user monitor, and friend monitor.

User Monitor:
  This adds to the bot api UserComment(comment) and UserPost(post)
Friend Monitor:
  This adds to the bot api FriendPost(post)
